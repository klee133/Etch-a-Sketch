# Etch-a-Sketch
This is my submission for the [Etch-a-Sketch project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch) in the Odin Project.

This is a simple webpage version of Etch-a-Sketch that has 4 button options:
- Create a new grid with new dimensions
- Toggle on/off random colors
- Toggle on/off increasing opacity
- Clear the grid

Future ideas to implement:
- Draw on mouse down to let user have more control over drawing
- Option to choose color
- Grid size input or range slider
- Eraser option
- Option to save drawing as an image
- Add more structure and design to webpage to make more visually aesthetic
